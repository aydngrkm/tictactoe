# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe with AI! This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI opponent.

## How to Play
**Objective:** Get three of your symbols (either X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game.
**Gameplay:** You and the AI will take turns placing your symbols on a 3x3 grid. The first player to achieve a winning pattern wins the game.
**Starting the Game:** To start the game, simply click on an empty cell in the grid to place your symbol. The AI will automatically make its move after you.
**Winning:** If you win, the game will congratulate you and offer the option to play again. If the game ends in a draw, it will let you know and prompt you to start a new game.
